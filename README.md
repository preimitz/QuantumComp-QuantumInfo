# Quantum Computing Study

This repository documents my self-study journey through Quantum Computing. To learn Quantum Computing, I will mostly use the book *"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information"* by Nielsen & Chuang and the IBM Quantum Platform. Furthermore, I will use tutorials for learnin Qiskit and PennyLane.

## 🧠 Goals

- Understand the mathematical foundations of quantum computing.
- Implement quantum algorithms using modern tools like Qiskit and PennyLane.
- Build a collection of Jupyter notebooks for simulation and visualization.

## 📚 References

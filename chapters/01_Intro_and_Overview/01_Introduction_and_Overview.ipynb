    "## The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell: Quantum computation and quantum information is the study of the information processing tasks that can be accomplished using quantum mechanical systems. One of the goals of quantum computation and quantum information is to develop tools which sharpen our intuition about quantum mechanics, and make its predictions more transparent to human minds (e.g. 'no-cloning theorem', or control over single quantum systems). \n",
    "\n",
    "Classical Computer limits: Moore's law which states that computer power will double for constant cost roughly once very two years. This will end soon since conventional approaches to the fabrication of computer technology run up against fundamental difficulties of size where quantum effects are beginning to interfere in the functioning of electronic devises as they are made smaller and smaller. Hence, one possible solution is to shift to quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency in Computer Science: Roughly speaking, an efficient algorithm is one which runs in time polynomial in the size of the problem solved. An inefficient algorithm requires superpolynomial (typ. exponential) time. Effects of realistic noise must be taken into account in evaluating the efficiency of a computational models. This was one of the great early challenges of quantum computation and quantum information and led to the development of a theory of quantum error-correcting codes, and fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems to tackle with Quantum Computers: Algorithm design for quantum computers is hard because designers face two difficult problems not faced in the construction of algorithms for classical computers: 1. Our huma intuition is rooted in the classical world, 2. The algorithm must be better than any exisiting classical algorithm. A major challenge for the future of quantum computation and quantum information is to find problems of real-world importance for which distributed quantum computation offers a substantial advantage over distributed classical computation.\n",

    "Quantum computation and quantum information are built upon the quantum bit, or qubit for short. **Qubits**  are the basic unit of quantum information. Two possible states for a qubit are the states |0‚ü© and |1‚ü©, but it can also form a linear combination of states, called superposition:\n",
    " - |œà‚ü© = Œ±|0‚ü© + Œ≤|1‚ü©\n",
    " \n",
    "with compleex numbers Œ±, Œ≤. The states |0‚ü© and |1‚ü© are a computational basis, and form an orthonormla basis of a two-dimensional complex vector space. Whereas we can examine a bit to determine whether it is in the state 0 or 1, the quantum state of a qubit cannot be determined, that is, the values of Œ±, and Œ≤. Quantum mechanics only tells us that we get the result Œ± with probability $|Œ±|^2$, and Œ≤ with probability $|Œ≤|^2$ and the probabilities must sum up to one $|Œ±|^2+|Œ≤|^2=1$. Thus, a qubit's state is a unit vector in a two-dim. complex vector space. Qubits can be manipulated and transformed in ways which lead to measurement outcomes which depend distinctly on the different properties of the state. These quantum states have real, experimental verifiable consequences, which are essential to the power of quantum computation and quantum information. \n",

    "Examples: two different polarizations of a photon; the alignment of a nuclear spin in a uniform magnetic field; two states of an electron orbiting a single atom (ground, or excited state)\n",

    "|œà‚ü© = cos(\\theta/2)|0‚ü© + e^{i\\varphi} sin(\\theta/2)|1‚ü©\n",
